nexmo-game for the contest

In this game you can test your knowledge about your contacts in five categories:

* Which carrier does your contact use?
* Which kind of network does the number use?
* Which country prefix does the number use?
* In which country has the number been registered?
* Which is your contact's phone number?

The information of the phone number is obtained by using Nexmo's Beta APIs: Number Insight Standard and Number Insight Basic APIs.

You can learn about these APIs in the following link: https://labs.nexmo.com/
